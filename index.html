Static asset handling

My adventure-pass-vendors-list.html file

Cannot GET /adventure-pass-vendors-list.html
:5000/adventure-pass-vendors-list.html 
Failed to load resource. Server responded with status of 404 not found
Cannot read property 'querySelectorAll' of null

assetsInclude is an extension string

FETCH

fetch local file only works when it's in the same directory as index.html
Edit: Not true. Wrong file path. 

fetch(local file) works in development, but not in production. 
There's probably something in the build process that causes this, like optimization/bundling/minification. For example, I no longer see vendors.json file. 
With create-react-app, we can put static assets in public folder. 
Doesn't work with vite. 
Vite will copy files in public folder to the dist folder. 

BEFORE
public folder
- vendors-headers.json
- vendors.json

AFTER
dist folder 
- assets folder (css, js)
- index.html
- vendors-headers.json
- vendors.json

Therefore, if you use fetch()
In development, the path needs to be "/public/vendors.json"
In production, the path needs to be "/vendors.json"

Look for build options.

Don't use fetch() with local files. Use import instead. 
Only use fetch() with local files if you're going to replace with a url later.
